BrannVRn was our bachelor's degree final project—a Virtual Reality fire safety training simulator developed in collaboration with Sykehuspartner. The project earned an A grade and taught us invaluable lessons about VR development, teamwork, and educational design.

## The Challenge

Sykehuspartner needed an effective way to train employees on fire safety procedures. Traditional training methods can be costly, time-consuming, and lack the immersive quality needed to truly prepare people for emergency situations. Our solution was to create a 1:1 scale virtual replica of their Drammen office where users could practice fire safety skills in a realistic but safe environment.

## My Role: Concept Art & UI/UX Design

As the concept artist and UI/UX designer on our three-person team, I was responsible for:

- Developing the visual concept and art direction
- Designing all user interface elements and infographics
- Creating informational displays about fire hazards and safety procedures
- Texturing and applying skins to 3D assets
- Ensuring the educational content was clear and accessible

## The Importance of Pedagogical Design

A key insight from this project was understanding that a training simulator needs to be more than just visually accurate—it must effectively teach. I focused on creating intuitive visuals and UI components that would help users absorb information naturally while immersed in the virtual environment.

The informational graphics explaining fire safety equipment—extinguishers, fire hoses, and alarm systems—were carefully integrated into the environment so users could learn at their own pace before practicing hands-on.

## Learning from Firefighters

One of the most valuable experiences was visiting the local fire station. The firefighters generously shared their expertise, demonstrating equipment use and explaining fire behavior. Their insights about which parts of a fire are most dangerous and how smoke spreads through buildings directly informed our design choices.

## Technical Implementation

Built in Unreal Engine for VR platforms, the project required:

- Precise 1:1 scale recreation of the office environment
- Realistic interaction design for fire safety equipment
- 360-degree camera integration for escape route visualization
- Intuitive VR controls for users of varying technical abilities

## Key Takeaways

This project taught me that the best educational tools balance technical accuracy with user-centered design. Working with real-world experts (the firefighters) and stakeholders (Sykehuspartner) showed me how multidisciplinary collaboration leads to stronger outcomes.

The A grade reflected not just the technical quality, but the meaningful educational impact of our work. It remains one of my proudest achievements.

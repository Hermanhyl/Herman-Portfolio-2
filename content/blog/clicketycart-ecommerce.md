ClicketyCart is what happens when you combine modern React development with retro-inspired design. Built as a project assignment with Madelen Sletteberg, this e-commerce frontend makes shopping feel fast, fun, and effortless.

## The Concept

The tagline says it all: "Turbo-charged checkout and lightning-fast delivery—quicker than you can say add to cart." The entire design embraces speed and playfulness while maintaining full e-commerce functionality.

## Features

### Product Browsing
Users can browse the full product catalog, powered by the Noroff API. Each product displays images, descriptions, and pricing.

### Shopping Cart
A fully functional cart with:
- Add/remove items
- Quantity adjustments
- Real-time total calculation

### Checkout Flow
A smooth checkout process that feels quick and satisfying.

## Post-Submission Improvements

After completing and submitting ClicketyCart, we revisited the project to make meaningful improvements.

### JSDoc Documentation
The original code had no function documentation. Adding JSDoc comments to all core JavaScript functions improved:
- Code clarity
- Maintainability
- Collaboration potential

JSDoc is standard practice in professional environments, and this update brought ClicketyCart in line with industry expectations.

### Clickable Logo
A simple but important UX improvement—the header logo now links back to the homepage. Users expect this behavior, and the original version was missing it.

### README Enhancement
Adding a screenshot to the README gives visitors a quick visual overview on GitHub. This makes the project more portfolio-friendly and accessible.

### Form Accessibility
Some interactive elements weren't properly wrapped in semantic form elements. Correcting this improved:
- Accessibility for screen reader users
- Keyboard navigation
- Overall HTML semantics

## Design with Figma

The complete design lives in Figma, including all page layouts and component designs. Having this upfront planning made development smoother and ensured the retro aesthetic was consistent throughout.

## Collaboration

Working with Madelen Sletteberg meant combining different perspectives and skills. We divided tasks based on strengths while reviewing each other's work to maintain quality.

## Lessons Learned

ClicketyCart reinforced that projects don't end at submission. The improvements we made afterward—documentation, accessibility, UX refinements—represent the kind of continuous improvement that professional projects require.

ClicketyCart is what happens when you combine modern React development with retro-inspired design. Built as a project assignment with Madelen Sletteberg, this e-commerce frontend makes shopping feel fast, fun, and effortless.

## The Concept

The tagline says it all: "Turbo-charged checkout and lightning-fast delivery-quicker than you can say add to cart." The entire design embraces speed and playfulness while maintaining full e-commerce functionality.

## Features

### Product Browsing
Users can browse the full product catalog, powered by the Noroff API. Each product displays images, descriptions, and pricing.

### Shopping Cart
A fully functional cart with:
- Add/remove items
- Quantity adjustments
- Real-time total calculation

### Checkout Flow
A smooth checkout process that feels quick and satisfying.

## Post-Submission Improvements

After completing and submitting ClicketyCart, we revisited the project to make meaningful improvements.

### JSDoc Documentation
The original code had no function documentation. Adding JSDoc comments to all core JavaScript functions improved:
- Code clarity
- Maintainability
- Collaboration potential

JSDoc is standard practice in professional environments, and this update brought ClicketyCart in line with industry expectations.

### Clickable Logo
A simple but important UX improvement-the header logo now links back to the homepage. Users expect this behavior, and the original version was missing it.

### README Enhancement
Adding a screenshot to the README gives visitors a quick visual overview on GitHub. This makes the project more portfolio-friendly and accessible.

### Form Accessibility
Some interactive elements weren't properly wrapped in semantic form elements. Correcting this improved:
- Accessibility for screen reader users
- Keyboard navigation
- Overall HTML semantics

## My Design Process

Before any development began, I followed my structured design workflow to ensure ClicketyCart was well-planned and cohesive.

### 1. Mind Mapping & Information Architecture
The process started with mapping out the complete e-commerce flow: homepage, product listings, individual product pages, shopping cart, checkout, and confirmation. I identified how users would navigate between pages and what paths lead to conversion.

### 2. Ideation & Concept Exploration
For ClicketyCart, ideation focused on finding the right balance between retro aesthetics and modern e-commerce UX. We explored different visual directions-neon signs, pixel art, vintage typography-before landing on our playful, speed-focused concept.

### 3. Wireframing
Low-fidelity wireframes mapped out the structure: product grid layouts, cart functionality placement, checkout form flow. No styling yet-just boxes and content hierarchy to get the user experience right.

### 4. Style Guide Development
The retro theme required a carefully crafted style guide:
- **Typography**: Fonts that evoke retro vibes while remaining readable
- **Color Palette**: Bold, fun colors that support the playful brand
- **Button Styles**: Prominent CTAs for "Add to Cart" and checkout actions
- **Spacing System**: Consistent rhythm throughout the shopping experience
- **Component Library**: Product cards, cart items, form elements

### 5. High-Fidelity Design (Mobile First)
Following mobile-first principles, I designed the complete mobile shopping experience first. Product browsing, cart management, and checkout all needed to work seamlessly on phones before expanding to larger screens.

### 6. Desktop Adaptation
Desktop designs took advantage of additional space with multi-column product grids, persistent cart previews, and expanded product detail layouts.

### 7. Prototyping
An interactive prototype simulated the complete shopping journey: browsing products, adding to cart, adjusting quantities, and completing checkout. This caught UX friction points before development.

## Collaboration

Working with Madelen Sletteberg meant combining different perspectives and skills. We divided tasks based on strengths while reviewing each other's work to maintain quality.

## Lessons Learned

ClicketyCart reinforced that projects don't end at submission. The improvements we made afterward-documentation, accessibility, UX refinements-represent the kind of continuous improvement that professional projects require.

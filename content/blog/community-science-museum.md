The Community Science Museum website was my second compulsory assignment at Noroff. I want to be upfront: this project does not reflect my abilities as a developer today. It's included in my portfolio to show my learning journey-where I came from and how far I've traveled since.

## The Brief

Create a modern, accessible website for a community science museum. The challenge was appealing to younger audiences without being patronizing-finding the balance between excitement and professionalism.

## What I Built

Using HTML and CSS (no JavaScript yet), I created a multi-page website featuring:

- Homepage with engaging visuals
- Exhibition information pages
- Event listings
- Contact and visitor information

## What I Learned

### Responsive Design Foundations
This project pushed me to think about how websites adapt to different screen sizes. I learned about media queries, flexible layouts, and the importance of testing across devices.

### Accessibility Awareness
The brief emphasized accessibility, introducing me to concepts like:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Alt text for images
- Color contrast considerations
- Keyboard navigation basics

These early lessons planted seeds that continue to influence my work today.

### Design Considerations
Thinking about the target audience (young visitors to a science museum) taught me that design isn't just about aesthetics-it's about communication and appropriateness.

## My Design Process

Even as an early project, I followed a design-first approach in Figma that established habits I still use today.

### 1. Mind Mapping & Information Architecture
I started by mapping out all the pages the museum website would need-homepage, exhibitions, events, about, contact-and how visitors would navigate between them. This helped me understand the complete site structure before designing anything.

### 2. Ideation & Concept Exploration
The ideation phase involved exploring how to make science exciting for young audiences without being childish. I considered different visual directions: bright and playful vs. sleek and futuristic, settling on an approach that felt educational yet engaging.

### 3. Wireframing
Simple wireframes helped me plan content placement: where the hero section would be, how to display exhibition cards, what information visitors need most prominently. Just basic shapes and text-no styling yet.

### 4. Style Guide Development
I created a basic style guide including:
- **Typography**: Kid-friendly but readable fonts for different heading levels
- **Color Palette**: Colors that feel scientific and exciting
- **Button Styles**: Clear call-to-action designs
- **Spacing Rules**: Consistent margins and padding

### 5. High-Fidelity Design (Mobile First)
Following mobile-first principles, I designed the mobile experience first-ensuring content was accessible on phones before scaling up. This was one of my first experiences with this methodology.

### 6. Desktop Adaptation
Desktop designs expanded the layouts with multi-column grids and larger imagery while maintaining the same content hierarchy.

### 7. Prototyping
A simple prototype linked the pages together to simulate the visitor journey through the website.

This early design process, though simpler than my current workflow, taught me the value of planning before coding.

## Building on GameHub

This project came after GameHub, my first-ever project. Comparing the two showed my early progress:

- Better HTML structure
- More organized CSS
- Improved layout techniques
- Growing awareness of best practices

## The Bigger Picture

I believe in showing the full learning process. Not every project needs to be a masterpiece-some are stepping stones. This project, along with GameHub, demonstrates that growth takes time and every step matters.

Looking at my recent work compared to these early projects shows the value of persistence. Every developer starts somewhere, and continued learning makes all the difference.

## Why It's Still Here

Portfolios often only show polished work, but I think there's value in honesty about the journey. These early projects prove that improvement is possible for anyone willing to keep learning and building.

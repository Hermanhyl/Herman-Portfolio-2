Having a background in both design and development has shaped how I approach building web interfaces.

## Design Phase

I start every project in Figma, creating comprehensive designs that include:
- Component libraries
- Responsive breakpoints
- Interactive prototypes
- Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)

## Development Phase

With a solid design foundation, I translate designs to code using:
- Tailwind CSS for rapid styling
- Component-driven architecture
- Design tokens as CSS variables
- Responsive-first approach

## The Bridge

The key is maintaining design consistency while embracing web-native patterns. Not everything from design transfers directly - and that's okay.

## Tools & Techniques

- Figma plugins for design tokens
- Tailwind for consistent spacing
- CSS variables for theming
- Storybook for component documentation

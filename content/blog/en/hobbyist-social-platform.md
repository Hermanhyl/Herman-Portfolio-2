In a world where digital interactions often feel shallow, Hobbyist was born from a simple idea: meaningful connections come from shared experiences. Unlike dating apps, this platform focuses on building genuine friendships through activities people actually enjoy.

## The Concept

Hobbyist connects people through their hobbies. Looking for a hiking buddy? A board game partner? Someone to take a cooking class with? The platform makes it easy to find locals who share your passions.

## Design Philosophy

One of my key goals was differentiating Hobbyist from the typical dating app aesthetic. The design choices reflect this:

### Warm Color Palette
The coral and orange gradient creates an inviting, friendly atmosphere. These colors feel energetic and community-focused—perfect for a platform about shared activities.

### Inclusive Imagery
All imagery emphasizes groups and activities rather than individuals. This reinforces that Hobbyist is about community, not romantic matchmaking.

### Friendly Typography
The typography choices lean toward approachable and casual, making users feel welcome rather than judged.

## Key Features

### Activity Browsing
Users can explore a wide range of hobby categories:
- Outdoor adventures (hiking, cycling, kayaking)
- Creative pursuits (photography, painting, cooking)
- Games and sports (board games, tennis, basketball)
- Learning activities (book clubs, language exchange)

### User Profiles
Profiles showcase interests and preferred activities, making it easy to find compatible activity partners.

### Clean Dashboard
The dashboard helps users manage connections and upcoming events without feeling overwhelmed.

## Technical Implementation

Built with React and Vite for optimal performance, Hobbyist uses:

- **Supabase** for authentication and real-time database functionality
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, consistent styling
- **Component-driven architecture** for maintainability

The real-time capabilities mean users can see updates instantly—new activity postings, messages, and connection requests appear without page refreshes.

## Future Plans

The roadmap includes:
- Activity scheduling and RSVP functionality
- Group chat for activity participants
- Calendar integration
- Location-based recommendations
- Rating system for activities and organizers

## What I Learned

Hobbyist taught me that design communicates values. Every color, font, and layout choice either reinforces or undermines the platform's core message. By intentionally moving away from dating app conventions, the design helps users understand immediately what Hobbyist is about.

Holidaze represents the culmination of our frontend development studies at Noroff—a collaborative project that earned an A grade and taught us invaluable lessons about teamwork, code quality, and building real-world applications.

## The Project

Working with Veronika Aas and Madelen Sletteberg, we created a booking platform for slow-living getaways. Think forest cabins, mountain retreats, and peaceful escapes from busy city life. The warm, cozy aesthetic reflects this focus on relaxation and mindful travel.

## Our Approach

From day one, we prioritized collaboration and communication:

### Clear Task Division
We divided responsibilities based on our strengths while ensuring everyone participated in all aspects—planning, design, and implementation.

### GitHub Workflow
Version control with clear commit messages kept us organized. We could track progress, review each other's code, and collaborate efficiently even when working asynchronously.

### Consistent Code Style
Using Prettier and agreed-upon conventions meant our code looked unified despite having three different authors.

## Technical Stack

- **React + Vite**: Fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS**: Consistent, responsive styling
- **Noroff API**: Backend functionality for venues and bookings
- **Figma**: Comprehensive design planning

## Key Features

### Venue Browsing
Users can browse handpicked getaways with beautiful imagery and detailed descriptions.

### Booking System
A smooth booking flow from discovery to confirmation, with clear pricing and availability.

### User Management
Registered users can manage their bookings, view history, and update profiles.

## Lessons Learned

### Error Handling Matters
One area we identified for improvement was comprehensive error handling. Some API calls lacked proper try/catch blocks, which we addressed in post-submission updates.

### Accessibility is Ongoing
While we implemented many accessibility features, there's always room to enhance keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

### Communication is Everything
The success of Holidaze came down to how well we communicated. Regular check-ins, clear documentation, and willingness to help each other made the difference.

## The Result

Receiving an A validated not just our technical skills, but our ability to work as a team. The project demonstrated that good collaboration produces better outcomes than any individual could achieve alone.

## Viewing the Project

The complete design is available in Figma, and the live site demonstrates all our implemented features. Check out the GitHub repository for documentation and setup instructions.

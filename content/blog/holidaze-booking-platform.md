Holidaze represents the culmination of our frontend development studies at Noroff-a collaborative project that earned an A grade and taught us invaluable lessons about teamwork, code quality, and building real-world applications.

## The Project

Working with Veronika Aas and Madelen Sletteberg, we created a booking platform for slow-living getaways. Think forest cabins, mountain retreats, and peaceful escapes from busy city life. The warm, cozy aesthetic reflects this focus on relaxation and mindful travel.

## Our Approach

From day one, we prioritized collaboration and communication:

### Clear Task Division
We divided responsibilities based on our strengths while ensuring everyone participated in all aspects-planning, design, and implementation.

### GitHub Workflow
Version control with clear commit messages kept us organized. We could track progress, review each other's code, and collaborate efficiently even when working asynchronously.

### Consistent Code Style
Using Prettier and agreed-upon conventions meant our code looked unified despite having three different authors.

## Technical Stack

- **React + Vite**: Fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS**: Consistent, responsive styling
- **Noroff API**: Backend functionality for venues and bookings
- **Figma**: Comprehensive design planning

## My Design Process

Every project I work on follows a structured design workflow that ensures the final product is well-thought-out and user-centered.

### 1. Mind Mapping & Information Architecture
I start by creating a mind map to gather all the pages needed and visualize how they interconnect. For Holidaze, this meant mapping out the user journey from landing page to venue discovery to booking confirmation, identifying which pages link to others and which stand alone.

### 2. Ideation & Concept Exploration
Next comes the ideation phase where we bounced ideas around-exploring different approaches for the booking flow, considering various visual directions that could evoke that "cozy cabin" feeling. We discussed what would work best for our target audience seeking slow-living getaways.

### 3. Wireframing
With our direction set, I moved to simple wireframes-low-fidelity layouts focusing purely on structure and content hierarchy. No colors, no fancy fonts-just boxes and placeholder text to nail down the user flow and page layouts.

### 4. Style Guide Development
Before diving into high-fidelity designs, I established a comprehensive style guide including:
- **Typography**: Font choices for headings (H1-H6), body text, and UI elements with specific sizes
- **Color Palette**: Primary, secondary, and accent colors that evoke warmth and relaxation
- **Button Styles**: Primary, secondary, and ghost button designs with hover/active states
- **Spacing System**: Consistent margins and padding rules
- **Layout Grid**: Column structure and breakpoint definitions

### 5. High-Fidelity Design (Mobile First)
Following the mobile-first concept, I designed the complete mobile experience first. This ensures the core content and functionality work on the smallest screens before scaling up. Every screen was designed to show exactly how the finished product would look.

### 6. Desktop Adaptation
Once mobile was solid, I expanded the designs to desktop, taking advantage of the extra screen real estate for multi-column layouts, larger imagery, and enhanced navigation.

### 7. Prototyping
Finally, I created an interactive prototype in Figma simulating the user journey-page transitions, button interactions, form behaviors, and animations. This let us test the experience before writing any code.

## Key Features

### Venue Browsing
Users can browse handpicked getaways with beautiful imagery and detailed descriptions.

### Booking System
A smooth booking flow from discovery to confirmation, with clear pricing and availability.

### User Management
Registered users can manage their bookings, view history, and update profiles.

## Lessons Learned

### Error Handling Matters
One area we identified for improvement was comprehensive error handling. Some API calls lacked proper try/catch blocks, which we addressed in post-submission updates.

### Accessibility is Ongoing
While we implemented many accessibility features, there's always room to enhance keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

### Communication is Everything
The success of Holidaze came down to how well we communicated. Regular check-ins, clear documentation, and willingness to help each other made the difference.

## The Result

Receiving an A validated not just our technical skills, but our ability to work as a team. The project demonstrated that good collaboration produces better outcomes than any individual could achieve alone.

## Viewing the Project

The complete design is available in Figma, and the live site demonstrates all our implemented features. Check out the GitHub repository for documentation and setup instructions.

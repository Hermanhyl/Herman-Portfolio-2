After two years of working with React, I've settled on a set of patterns that consistently help me write cleaner, more maintainable code.

## Custom Hooks for Logic Reuse

Custom hooks are my go-to for extracting and reusing component logic. They keep components focused on rendering while keeping logic testable.

## Compound Components

For complex UI components, compound components provide a flexible API that's easy to understand and use.

## Optimizing with useMemo and useCallback

Strategic use of memoization has significantly improved performance in my applications, especially with large lists and complex calculations.

## Conclusion

These patterns have made my React code more maintainable and performant. They're not silver bullets, but they've proven valuable in real-world projects.

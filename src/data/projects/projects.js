We also made sure to follow best practices for code quality and maintainability.File structure is organized, with components, styles, and assets separated for clarity. We used Tailwind CSS for styling, which allowed us to create a responsive and visually appealing design without writing custom CSS.",

In the current version, some API calls do not have proper error handling, which could lead to a poor user experience if something goes wrong. We plan to implement try/catch blocks and display user-friendly error messages in future updates.\n\nAdditionally, we want to improve the accessibility of the application. While we have made some efforts to ensure that the app is usable by people with disabilities, there are still areas where we can enhance keyboard navigation and screen reader support.",

        content: "In the original version of the project, none of the functions were documented. To improve clarity and maintainability, I added JSDoc comments across all core JavaScript functions. JSDoc helps define the purpose, expected parameters, and return values of each function, making it easier for others (and my future self) to understand the logic behind the code. This is especially valuable when collaborating or revisiting the code after some time, and it's a standard practice in professional development environments.",

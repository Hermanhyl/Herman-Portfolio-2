The firefighters' feedback on our early designs helped us prioritize the most critical learning objectives.",

I designed UI elements that feel natural to interact with while wearing a headset\n• Readability at distance: Text and graphics needed to remain legible across varying distances within the virtual environment\n• Comfort considerations: Avoiding UI placements that cause neck strain or motion discomfort during extended use\n• Intuitive interactions: Creating affordances that communicate how objects can be manipulated without explicit instructions\n\nThese challenges taught me that good UX design principles are universal, but their application must adapt to each medium's unique constraints and opportunities.",

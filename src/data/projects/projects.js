The learning design approach was central to every decision I made.\n\nKey pedagogical principles I applied:\n\n• Progressive disclosure: Information is revealed in stages, preventing cognitive overload while building understanding systematically\n• Learn-then-practice flow: Users first read about equipment functionality, then immediately practice hands-on—reinforcing learning through action\n• Contextual learning: Educational content is placed exactly where users need it, integrated naturally into the environment rather than interrupting the experience\n• Multiple learning modalities: Visual diagrams, text explanations, and hands-on practice accommodate different learning styles\n\nThe goal was creating an experience where users naturally absorb safety knowledge while immersed in the virtual environment, making the learning feel effortless rather than forced.",

Their real-world expertise fundamentally shaped our design approach.\n\nKey insights that influenced the project:\n\n• Fire behavior: Understanding how fire spreads, which areas become dangerous first, and why certain escape routes are prioritized over others\n• Equipment priorities: Learning which equipment to use in different scenarios and the critical decision-making process firefighters follow\n• Common mistakes: Discovering what untrained people typically do wrong in emergencies—information that directly shaped our tutorial design\n• Psychological factors: Understanding how panic affects decision-making and how proper training can override fear responses\n\nThis collaboration ensured our simulator teaches what actually matters in emergencies—not just textbook procedures, but the practical knowledge that saves lives. The firefighters' feedback on our early designs helped us prioritize the most critical learning objectives.",

I designed UI elements that feel natural to interact with while wearing a headset\n• Readability at distance: Text and graphics needed to remain legible across varying distances within the virtual environment\n• Comfort considerations: Avoiding UI placements that cause neck strain or motion discomfort during extended use\n• Intuitive interactions: Creating affordances that communicate how objects can be manipulated without explicit instructions\n\nThese challenges taught me that good UX design principles are universal, but their application must adapt to each medium's unique constraints and opportunities.",

        heading: "Key Takeaways",

You can start fresh by creating a new Excel file from scratch, or load an existing Excel file to continue where you left off. When you load an existing file, all your previous entries are imported and displayed in the dashboard.\n\nAs you add new income entries—specifying the source, amount, and month—the app automatically calculates social insurance deductions and updates your totals. The dashboard reflects changes in real-time with updated charts and summaries.\n\nWhen you're done, you have full control over saving your data. You can save changes back to the same Excel file you loaded, overwriting it with your updates, or save to a new file to keep different versions. The Excel files are stored wherever you choose on your device, giving you complete ownership of your financial records. This means you can back them up, move them between devices, or organize them however you prefer.",

JSDoc helps define the purpose, expected parameters, and return values of each function, making it easier for others (and my future self) to understand the logic behind the code. This is especially valuable when collaborating or revisiting the code after some time, and it's a standard practice in professional development environments.",

We corrected this by ensuring all input fields are properly structured within semantic form tags, improving both functionality and compliance with accessibility standards.",

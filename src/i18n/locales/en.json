Their real-world expertise fundamentally shaped our design approach.\n\nKey insights that influenced the project:\n\n• Fire behavior: Understanding how fire spreads, which areas become dangerous first, and why certain escape routes are prioritized over others\n• Equipment priorities: Learning which equipment to use in different scenarios and the critical decision-making process firefighters follow\n• Common mistakes: Discovering what untrained people typically do wrong in emergencies—information that directly shaped our tutorial design\n• Psychological factors: Understanding how panic affects decision-making and how proper training can override fear responses\n\nThis collaboration ensured our simulator teaches what actually matters in emergencies—not just textbook procedures, but the practical knowledge that saves lives. The firefighters' feedback on our early designs helped us prioritize the most critical learning objectives."

Direct conversations revealed pain points I never would have guessed\n• Prioritize based on frequency: The features users mentioned most often became the highest priority—photo support and statistics came up in nearly every conversation\n• Context matters: Understanding that anglers log catches while fishing—often in challenging conditions—influenced decisions about interface simplicity and button sizes\n• Existing solutions aren't sacred: Just because other apps do something a certain way doesn't mean it's right. User frustrations with competitors became opportunities for differentiation\n\nThe research-first approach took more time upfront but resulted in a more focused, useful application."

          "heading": "Gathering User Insights",
          "content": "While this wasn't a formal user study, the informal conversations I had proved invaluable. I asked people about their experiences with social apps, what frustrated them, and what they'd hope to find in a hobby-focused platform.\n\nCommon themes emerged:\n\n• Simplicity over complexity: People wanted to find activities quickly without navigating through endless menus and options\n• Clear information hierarchy: Users expressed wanting to see the most important details—what, when, where—at a glance\n• Messaging that feels natural: Communication features should be straightforward, not buried or overcomplicated\n• Organized presentation: Activities should be easy to browse and filter without feeling overwhelming\n• Welcoming atmosphere: The platform should feel friendly and approachable, not intimidating for newcomers\n\nThese insights became guiding principles for every design decision."

          "content": "One of the clearest takeaways from my conversations was the desire for simplicity. People didn't want another app cluttered with buttons, notifications, and features competing for attention.\n\nThis shaped the interface in several ways:\n\n• Clean navigation: Essential functions are easy to find without hunting through menus\n• Focused screens: Each view has a clear purpose without unnecessary distractions\n• Intuitive flow: Moving through the app feels natural—browse activities, see details, connect with people\n• Minimal clicks: Getting from discovery to connection requires as few steps as possible\n\nThe goal was an app that feels effortless to use, where users spend their energy on connecting with others rather than figuring out the interface."

          "heading": "UX Lessons Applied",
          "content": "This project reinforced important UX principles:\n\n• Listen before building: Even informal conversations reveal insights you wouldn't discover on your own\n• Simplicity requires discipline: It's tempting to add features, but restraint often serves users better\n• Context shapes design: Understanding how and why people would use the platform influenced everything from button placement to color choices\n• Warmth can be designed: Visual design choices—colors, typography, spacing—contribute to how welcoming an app feels\n\nThe feedback-informed approach resulted in a more focused, user-friendly platform than I would have created based on assumptions alone."

I organized the artwork into separate folders:\n\n• Original artwork - the imported Illustrator file, untouched\n• Rig composition - a duplicate where all the rigging was applied\n• Animation compositions - separate comps for each animation\n\nCrucially, in the rig composition, I made sure all bones, positions, and rotations are zeroed out to match exactly how the illustration was originally imported. This creates a 'base state' or neutral pose that I can always return to.\n\nThis organization serves two purposes: reusability and safety. Having a base state makes it much easier when animating—you can always reset to the natural position if something goes wrong or if you want to start a new animation from scratch. It's a best practice that saves time and prevents frustration during the animation process."

While the preparation wasn't perfect (as noted in the Walk & Run project), the rig still allows for a range of different animations.\n\nThis is where the project organization from the Walk & Run project pays off. Because I kept the original artwork separate, maintained a rig composition with all bones zeroed out to the base state, and created separate compositions for each animation—I could simply duplicate the rig comp and start animating this new movement without affecting the other animations. The zeroed-out base state meant I had a clean starting point for this completely different gesture."

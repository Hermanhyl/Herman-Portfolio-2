The learning design approach was central to every decision I made.\n\nKey pedagogical principles I applied:\n\n• Progressive disclosure: Information is revealed in stages, preventing cognitive overload while building understanding systematically\n• Learn-then-practice flow: Users first read about equipment functionality, then immediately practice hands-on—reinforcing learning through action\n• Contextual learning: Educational content is placed exactly where users need it, integrated naturally into the environment rather than interrupting the experience\n• Multiple learning modalities: Visual diagrams, text explanations, and hands-on practice accommodate different learning styles\n\nThe goal was creating an experience where users naturally absorb safety knowledge while immersed in the virtual environment, making the learning feel effortless rather than forced."

Their real-world expertise fundamentally shaped our design approach.\n\nKey insights that influenced the project:\n\n• Fire behavior: Understanding how fire spreads, which areas become dangerous first, and why certain escape routes are prioritized over others\n• Equipment priorities: Learning which equipment to use in different scenarios and the critical decision-making process firefighters follow\n• Common mistakes: Discovering what untrained people typically do wrong in emergencies—information that directly shaped our tutorial design\n• Psychological factors: Understanding how panic affects decision-making and how proper training can override fear responses\n\nThis collaboration ensured our simulator teaches what actually matters in emergencies—not just textbook procedures, but the practical knowledge that saves lives. The firefighters' feedback on our early designs helped us prioritize the most critical learning objectives."

          "heading": "UX Challenges in VR",

I designed UI elements that feel natural to interact with while wearing a headset\n• Readability at distance: Text and graphics needed to remain legible across varying distances within the virtual environment\n• Comfort considerations: Avoiding UI placements that cause neck strain or motion discomfort during extended use\n• Intuitive interactions: Creating affordances that communicate how objects can be manipulated without explicit instructions\n\nThese challenges taught me that good UX design principles are universal, but their application must adapt to each medium's unique constraints and opportunities."

We incorporated 3D photography techniques to capture the real environment and integrated this with our virtual recreations for a seamless training experience."

Rather than assuming I knew the answer, I went directly to the source—talking with anglers in the fishing community to understand their real experiences, frustrations, and wishes.\n\nThis user-centered approach shaped every feature in the app. Instead of building what I thought was useful, I built what fishermen told me they needed. The result is an application designed around genuine pain points rather than assumptions."

I had conversations with multiple fishermen—from casual weekend anglers to dedicated enthusiasts—asking about their current methods for tracking catches and what frustrated them about existing solutions.\n\nKey insights from these conversations:\n\n• No photo support: Several anglers mentioned that their current apps didn't allow image uploads, making it impossible to document catches visually—a feature many considered essential\n• Poor weather logging: Existing apps either lacked weather tracking entirely or made it too cumbersome to record conditions accurately\n• Missing statistics: Fishermen wanted to see patterns in their catches over time, but most apps offered no analytics or overview features\n• No comprehensive view: Users expressed frustration at not being able to see their complete fishing history at a glance\n• Cluttered interfaces: Many existing apps were overloaded with features that got in the way of the core task—quickly logging a catch\n\nThese pain points became the foundation for GoneFishing's feature set."

Supabase serves as the backend, handling authentication and data storage with real-time capabilities. Tailwind CSS provides a modern, responsive design that works seamlessly across devices—crucial for an app that needs to work equally well on a phone by the water or a desktop at home.\n\nSpecial attention was paid to the mobile experience, recognizing that most catch logging happens in the field. The interface is optimized for quick entries with minimal taps, respecting the context in which it's used."

Direct conversations revealed pain points I never would have guessed\n• Prioritize based on frequency: The features users mentioned most often became the highest priority—photo support and statistics came up in nearly every conversation\n• Context matters: Understanding that anglers log catches while fishing—often in challenging conditions—influenced decisions about interface simplicity and button sizes\n• Existing solutions aren't sacred: Just because other apps do something a certain way doesn't mean it's right. User frustrations with competitors became opportunities for differentiation\n\nThe research-first approach took more time upfront but resulted in a more focused, useful application."

This creates a 'base state' or neutral pose that I can always return to.\n\nThis organization serves two purposes: reusability and safety. Having a base state makes it much easier when animating—you can always reset to the natural position if something goes wrong or if you want to start a new animation from scratch. It's a best practice that saves time and prevents frustration during the animation process."

While the preparation wasn't perfect (as noted in the Walk & Run project), the rig still allows for a range of different animations.\n\nThis is where the project organization from the Walk & Run project pays off. Because I kept the original artwork separate, maintained a rig composition with all bones zeroed out to the base state, and created separate compositions for each animation—I could simply duplicate the rig comp and start animating this new movement without affecting the other animations. The zeroed-out base state meant I had a clean starting point for this completely different gesture."

It's a good exercise in isolating movement to specific body parts while maintaining overall character balance."

I'm aware of these principles and how they could enhance the animation, but for this portfolio demonstration, the priority was showcasing the technical workflow and rig versatility."
